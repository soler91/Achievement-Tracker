# Achievements-Master
Tracks achievement progress (list of tracked achievements are carried over playsessions - saved into a per-character file)
the achievement data is from NA, but if you put a datacenter achievements data into data.json instead - it'd be in your preferred language

Works fine on all regions, just the language of displayed text would be english

## Usage:
**Enable/Disable** (enabled by default if there are achievements to track)
**!a e**

**Add achievement to tracking list** (also adds all unfinished child achievements)

**!a a ID** (or exact full achievement name, for example -  "**!a a 915**" or "**!a a Easy as Pie**") alias - **a t**

Get achievements ID from http://teralore.com/us/achievements/

**Remove from tracking list** (once achievement is done it will be auto-removed from the list with a notification)

**!a r ID** (alias - **a d**)

**Clear tracking list** (delete all)

**a c**

**Save config immediately** (it is saved automatically when you close tera-proxy console window by default)

**a s**

**Show tracking list** (achievement names are clickable, achievement window would open on that exact one achievement)

**a l**
