# Achievements-Master
Tracks achievement progress (list of tracked achievements are carried over playsessions - saved into a per-character file)

Also makes it fairly easy to check if you have specific achievements and which of its requirements are already done.

the achievement data is from NA, but if you put a datacenter achievements data into data.json instead - it'd be in your preferred language


Works fine on all regions, just the language of displayed text would be english

## Usage:
**Enable/Disable** (enabled by default if there are achievements to track)

**!a e**

**Add achievement to tracking list** (also adds all unfinished child achievements)

**!a a ID** (or exact full achievement name, for example -  "**!a a 915**" or "**!a a Easy as Pie**") alias - **a t**

Get achievements IDs from http://teralore.com/us/achievements/

**Remove from tracking list** (once achievement is done it will be auto-removed from the list with a notification)

**!a r ID** (alias - **a d**)

**Clear tracking list** (delete all)

**!a c**

**Save config immediately** (it is saved automatically when you close tera-proxy console window by default)

**!a s**

**Show tracking list** (achievement names are clickable, achievement window would open on that exact one achievement)

**!a l**
